🧠💻 Physiotherapy – A Data Structures Project 🎯

We built a project that simulates a physiotherapy clinic using data structures like queues and linked lists.

👥 The system managed two types of patients:
Normal Patients
Recovery Patients 
Each patient had an ID, arrival time, and a number of treatments.
One interesting part: when a recovery patient joins the waiting list, they’re sent to the physiotherapist with the least total waiting time ⏱ — making the system more efficient and fair.
But overall, it was a great mix of logic, teamwork, and creativity. One of those projects that stick in your memory ✨
